I'm a software engineer passionate about building impactful tech solutions, making backend and mobile development accessible, and driving innovation across Africa. I specialize in backend development with Node.js and have recently transitioned into full-stack and mobile app development using Flutter and Supabase.
Some technologies I enjoy working with include Node.js, Nest.js, Supabase, and Flutter. I'm also exploring how AI and data engineering can unlock the next generation of African-led innovation. I believe in building in public and showing others that you don’t need perfect tools, just the will to start.
My interest in developer empowerment drives me to share knowledge and inspire more Africans to embrace tech as a tool for transformation. Let's build what we wish existed!
