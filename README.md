Hi, I'm Kings 👋🏽 💻

![BLack Minimalist Corporate Staff Identity LinkedIn Banner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4dc996a2-2f61-4844-9b2b-98babdc63104)

I'm a software engineer passionate about building impactful tech solutions, making backend and mobile development accessible, and driving innovation across Africa. I specialize in backend development with Node.js and have recently transitioned into full-stack and mobile app development using Flutter and Supabase.
Some technologies I enjoy working with include Node.js, PostgreSQL, Supabase, and Flutter. I'm also exploring how AI and data engineering can unlock the next generation of African-led innovation. I believe in building in public and showing others that you don’t need perfect tools — just the will to start.
My interest in developer empowerment drives me to share knowledge and inspire more Africans to embrace tech as a tool for transformation. Let's build what we wish existed!
